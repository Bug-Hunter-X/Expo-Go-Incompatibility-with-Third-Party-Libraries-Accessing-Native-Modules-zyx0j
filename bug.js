This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test a React Native project that uses a third-party library which tries to access native modules that are not available in the Expo Go environment.  The library might attempt to interact with hardware or system functionalities unavailable within the sandboxed Expo Go context.  This leads to errors that don't manifest during development with a physical device or emulator because of the limitations of Expo Go.

Example:

```javascript
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

// ... other code

function MyComponent(){
  // This will work if you're not using Expo Go. 
  // If using Expo Go, it will produce an error as it tries to access native camera functionality
  // that is not available in the Expo Go environment.
  return (
    <Camera />
  );
}
```
