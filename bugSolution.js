To address this, you can use conditional logic to check if the necessary native module is available before attempting to use it.  If the module isn't available (as in the Expo Go environment), you can provide alternative functionality or display a placeholder.

```javascript
import { Camera, hasCameraPermissionsAsync } from 'expo-camera';
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = useState(null);
  const [type, setType] = useState(Camera.Constants.Type.back);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted');
    })();
  }, []);

  if (hasPermission === null) {
    return <View><Text>Requesting permissions...</Text></View>;
  }
  if (hasPermission === false) {
    return <Text>No access to camera</Text>;
  }
  return (
    <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} type={type}>

     {/* Camera component here */}
    </Camera>
  );
}
```

This improved example uses `hasCameraPermissionsAsync` to check for permissions before rendering the camera component.  If permission is not granted, a more user-friendly message is shown.  Remember this doesn't fully solve the issue in Expo Go, as camera functions may still cause issues, highlighting the need to test extensively outside Expo Go.
Alternatively, consider using Expo's managed workflow and EAS Build to avoid Expo Go limitations entirely.
